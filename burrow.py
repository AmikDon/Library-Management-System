#this module does the burrowing process. A function is defined which asks the user his/her name and the Book ID he/she wants to burrow.
#If the user inputs invalid ID, then the program asks the user to input a valid ID.
#If the required book is not available, the program tells that the required book is not available.
#If the quantity of the book that the user require is more than the quantity available in the library,
#the program tells that there is only certain quantity of the required book is available.
#If the amount of book the user needs is available in the library,
#then the program modifies the value of the quantity of the book from the txt file(available books before â€“amount of the books the user took).
#Then the program asks the user if he/she wants to burrow more books.
#If the user wishes to burrow more books then the same process is done from the start.
#If the user does not want to burrow more books, then the function ends.import datetime
